# Home Assistant CUPS Add-on

This repository hosts a Home Assistant add-on that installs and configures the
Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) so Android devices can print to your
network printers. The add-on is tuned for Raspberry Pi 3 based Home Assistant
systems but also supports other official architectures.

See [`cups/DOCS.md`](cups/DOCS.md) for installation and configuration details.
